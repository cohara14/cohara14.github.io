    <h1> Review of State's Websites </h1>

    <p><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a></p>
  <ui>
    <li> Florida was my favorite page due to its easy navigation, color scheme/design, and mostly for how easy it was to navigate. Right away when you enter the website you are presented a search bar where you are able to then search anything on the florida.gov website. I found this tool to be very helpful and easy to navigate. My only problem with this website was that the menu bar at the top was shallow, and there was not alot of options for links unless you are directly searching for something. If you were on the website to explore it might be difficult as opposed to going to the website looking for something in particular.

  <p><a href="https://www.alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></p>
  <li> I really enjoyed the layout and design of the Alaska website. I found the pictures to be interesting and the fact that you could click on pictures and be taken to those things was easy for navigation. This webiste felt very easy to explore and welcoming to someone from the tourist point of view. One thing that I believe the website failed to do was minimize text. While there are a few pictures with links, there is an abundance of text which makes it somewhat hard to navigate and explore.

  <p><a href="https://delaware.gov/">Delaware</a></p>
  <li> The Delaware website was easy to navigate with a main search bar as well as many menus to choose from. There was a lot of information to be gathered and a great amount of links taking you to other sources. However when clicking on the links I noticed that they were all quite slow to load, and it was somewhat difficult to navigate back to the main page as well as time consuming.

  <p><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois</a></p>
  <li> While the Illinois website had a personal virtual assitant feature that made asking questions easy and convinent, I was personally not a fan of the layout and design of the overall website. Navigation was fine if directly searching for something but diffuclt in terms of scrolling around. I also think that more pictures and colors could help make the website more visually appealing to the user.

  <p><a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/">Nebraska</a></p>
  <li> The Nebraska website also had a search bar that was easy to access and made for quick navigation. Along with the search bar there were alot of easy to read colorful visuals and graphs on the main page. However when navigating to outside links, similar to Delaware, the links were slow and hard to navigate once leaving the main sight.
