          <p><img src="summer.jpg" alt="summer" class="yessummer">In the summer, temperatures may increase to the hottest of the year. If they spike too high, heat waves or droughts may cause trouble for people, animals, and plants. For example, in the summer of 2003, the high temperatures claimed more than 30,000 lives, according to Encyclopedia Britannica. Rainfall may increase in some areas, as well. Others may receive less water, and forest fires may become more frequent. </p>

          <p>In June, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, the sunâ€™s rays hit it for a greater part of the day than in winter. This means it gets more hours of daylight. In December, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, with fewer hours of daylight.</p>

<li>The first modern Olympic Games were held in the summer in 1896 in Athens, Greece.</li>
<li>The first day of summer is between June 20th and June 22nd every year.</li>
<li>The last day of summer is September 20th.</li>
<li>Watermelon is one of summer's best summer treats</li>
