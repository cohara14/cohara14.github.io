  <h2><u>Stone Glacier </h2></u>
  <p>	When looking over the Stone Glacier website there are a large number of aesthetically pleasing things on a dark color pallet with lots of blues and greys. On this website, there are pictures that not only show the product but have links to where you can purchase that product within the website. If I were to see a jacket worn by someone in the picture on the website, chances are that same jacket can be found by clicking the link right with that image. This allows for easy shopping and great visuals. The website design is clean, and easy to navigate. It is primarily one column and you scroll down to see products. However, there is a menu bar with dropdown tabs at the top of the page that allows you to search for, and find all of their products with ease. My only complaint is that when dragging your mouse there are a lot of things that pop up as you cross them. While it is nice when you want to see that item up closer, it can be a pain when you are simply trying to scroll or tap your mouse. Overall it is an awesome website that is fun to explore, you can take a look for yourself here.

<h2><u> ESPN </h2></u>

<p> One of my most visited websites is ESPN. While looking at the ESPN website it is amazing how much information they are able to pack in there and still keep it clean and easy to navigate. One thing that I believe ESPN does well, is organizing the content on their page in way that is easy to navigate and read for someone that is visiting the website. They seem to follow a 3 column like pattern with two smaller columns on the outside with headlines, scores, and other additional links. While they have one main column in the middle with the big stories, pictures, and information that is most recent. Something that I was not a fan of on the website however was that there were large pop up ads scattered throughout the page as well as it was quite slow navigating the page. But overall an awesome website with good organization and accessibility.

<h2><u> Craigslist </h2></u>
<p> A website that I found to be â€œterrible was Craigslist. While this website gets the job done, it looks terrible and is hard to navigate. There are numerous columns and amounts of information on the website itself with the only visuals being what the sellers post about their products. While you are able to search for items, generally you will be presented with countless items that may not even be what you were looking for in the first place. Aside from that there are many items that pop up that are not even near you, and you have never searched for them. It is hard to navigate and very slow when clicking links and products. Overall, the website is outdated and is not a good website.
