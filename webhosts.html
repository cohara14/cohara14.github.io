  <p> My favorite web host was HostGator. The website was easy to navigate and for less than $10 I would be able to construct a well putogether colorful easy to navigate website. HostGator was also my top webhost due to the fact that there was a lot of support offered through the initial website to help you create your own website or webpage for your business.
